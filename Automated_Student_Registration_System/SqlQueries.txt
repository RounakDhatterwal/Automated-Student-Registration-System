enroll student in course ->   "insert into student_batch values (?,?)"
						      this will add one student into a batch it requires batch id and student id

						
add new courses ->            "insert into course (course_name, course_fee, course_duration, course_description) values(?,?,?,?)"
					          this will  add new courses into the system and this power lies in admin

					
search course details ->      "select * from course where course_name = ? OR Course_duration = ? OR course_fee = ?"
						      this will get you all details of the course on the basis of the course name and course duration and course fee

						
update course details ->      "update course set course_name = ? , course_fee = ? , course_duration = ? , course_description = ?  WHERE course_id = ?"
						      this will update course details on the basis of course id provided by the admin

						
create batch under course ->  "insert into batch (batch_name, batch_startdate, batch_enddate, batch_capacity, course_id) values(?,?,?,?,?)"
							  this will create a new batch under a course and we need to know course id under which course we want to add a batch

							
search batch ->               "select * from batch where batch_name = ? OR batch_startdate = ? OR batch_enddate = ?"
				              this will get you batch details if you enter batch name or startdtate or enddate

				
update batch ->               "update batch set batch_name = ? , batch_startdate = ? , batch_enddate = ? , batch_capacity = ? , course_id = ? WHERE batch_id = ?"
				              this will update batch details we need to enter batch id that we want to update

				
view student details ->       "select * from student where student_id = ?"
					          this will give you  a student details on the basis of student id

																			
view student batch list ->    "select s.firstname from student_batch b JOIN student s ON b.student_id = s.student_id WHERE b.batch_id = ?"
					          this will give you list of student under a particular batch 

						
get report ->                 "select c.course_id,count(b.batch_id),count(st.student_id) from course c INNER JOIN  batch b ON c.course_id = b.course_id \r\n"
						      + "INNER JOIN  student_batch sc ON b.batch_id = sc.batch_id INNER JOIN student st ON sc.student_id = st.student_id group by c.course_id;"
			                  this will give you the report of batch and course and student that which course has how many batches and which batch has how many students
